  abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

  abstract={Corrosion costs an estimated 3--4{\%} of GDP for most nations each year, leading to significant loss of assets. Research regarding automatic corrosion detection is ongoing, with recent progress leveraging advances in deep learning. Studies are hindered however, by the lack of a publicly available dataset. Thus, corrosion detection models use locally produced datasets suitable for the immediate conditions, but are unable to produce generalized models for corrosion detection. The corrosion detection model algorithms will output a considerable number of false positives and false negatives when challenged in the field. In this paper, we present a deep learning corrosion detector that performs pixel-level segmentation of corrosion. Moreover, three Bayesian variants are presented that provide uncertainty estimates depicting the confidence levels at each pixel, to better inform decision makers. Experiments were performed on a freshly collected dataset consisting of 225 images, discussed and validated herein.},

  abstract = {The training of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) concerns the selection of their structures and the connection weights. To efficiently enhance generalization capabilities of RNNs, a recurrent self-organizing neural networks (RSONN), using an adaptive growing and pruning algorithm (AGPA), is proposed for improving their performance in this paper. This AGPA can self-organize the structures of RNNs based on the information processing ability and competitiveness of hidden neurons in the learning process. Then, the hidden neurons of RSONN can be added or pruned to improve the generalization performance. Furthermore, an adaptive second-order algorithm with adaptive learning rate is employed to adjust the parameters of RSONN. And the convergence of RSONN is given to show the computational efficiency. To demonstrate the merits of RSONN for data modeling, several benchmark datasets and a real world application associated with nonlinear systems modeling problems are examined with comparisons against other existing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RSONN effectively simplifies the network structure and performs better than some exiting methods.}
